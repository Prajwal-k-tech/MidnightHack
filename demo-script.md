# ðŸŒ™ MIDNIGHT HACKATHON DEMO SCRIPT

## ðŸŽ¬ **2-MINUTE DEMO OUTLINE**

### **Opening (15 seconds)**
"Hey, I'm [Your Name] and this is my demo for the **Midnight Hackathon**. I built a privacy-first dating platform using Midnight's zero-knowledge proof technology."

### **Problem Statement (20 seconds)**
"Traditional dating apps expose your personal data - age, location, preferences. Our platform proves compatibility without revealing sensitive information using Midnight's ZK circuits."

### **Live Demo (60 seconds)**

#### **Part 1: Wallet Connection (15 seconds)**
- Show connecting Midnight Lace wallet
- Point out real blockchain integration: "Connected to Midnight testnet"

#### **Part 2: ZK Profile Registration (20 seconds)**
- Create profile with age, location, bio
- Show console: "Generated ZK commitments for registration"
- Point out real SHA-256 hashes being generated
- Show transaction hash in response

#### **Part 3: ZK Match Request (25 seconds)**
- Request match with another user
- Show console: "Requesting ZK match" with proof generation
- Explain: "The circuit verifies age/location compatibility without revealing actual data"
- Show successful match approval with blockchain transaction

### **Technical Architecture (20 seconds)**
"Built on Midnight's Compact smart contracts with real ZK circuits:
- `register()` - Stores encrypted profile commitments
- `requestMatch()` - Verifies compatibility via zero-knowledge proofs  
- `approveMatch()` - Enables private data exchange"

### **Long-term Vision (20 seconds)**
"This is the future of private social interactions. Imagine:
- Dating without catfish or privacy violations
- Social networks that don't harvest your data
- Professional networking with verified credentials
All powered by Midnight's privacy-preserving blockchain."

### **Closing (5 seconds)**
"Thank you! The code is public on GitHub, and this is just the beginning of privacy-first social platforms."
